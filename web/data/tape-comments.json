There are so many different things going on so whatever you were into there was tons of people doing the same thing. I was 15 sitting on my front porch the time is approx 5pm,  6 hours before My life would be changed forever! The neighbor kid Lou walks up. Lou is like 18 different than anyone around there. He wore hula Hoop Jenkos and Fuct shirts, rainbow sox w toes in them, everything was always bright colors. I always thought he was cool but he was always busy and I was younger, but today was my lucky day!! He said \"You should come check out this party tonight down in LA! Its gonna be sick!!\" Im in!!! \"Be ready around like midnight.\" Ok cool!! Seemed late to me but I had to go see WHAT was going on that I was missing out on. Its like 12:30 and Lou comes out of his house trippin balls \"Open up!! he said 2 dancing test tubes for you!\" Acid???? Oh shit I never tripped before but I been wanting too! \"HAHAHA Lou laughs for like 5mins before he says \"Tonight you will born in to the LA Underground, Lets go!\" Were flying down the hyway, Power tools is on the radio. I heard a little Techno up to this point in my life but mostly Rap and Metal. I didnt really know what happening?? The acid kicking in alittle and my head was bobbin to some bad ass sounds and Lou boppin all around the car lol, this was the coolest time I have had so far in life!! FUCK...I really had NO idea WHAT was about to go down!!! We pull up to the top of a parking garage Lou looks at me and says\" R U READY???\" Im pretty sure! I was feeling like something BIG was about to happen, man that acid was just starting to hit me and F it was STRONG!!!! I feel this rumble in the air!!  WOW Im feeling that acid!! We get to the street and a line of people!!!  Damn this is a long line! Every person that goes in I am 1 step closer! The anticipation is really, really high! I ask myself WHAT is going on in there??? There I am, next in!!! I give my 5bucks to the door guy. I walk in the music is pounding. I push the tarp to the side and BAM!!!! I finally found what was missing from my life!!!! WHAT! thats right! I never looked back. That was 27 years  ago. I cant imagine life without WHAT, Family, Double Hit Mickeys, Double Dare, Om Labs, Aqua, Open House, ECT.......over the years I brought RAW aka6blocc to denver, Jason Blakemoore aka DJ Trance to the east coast. I have played and produced ever since and would not be me with out Lou RIP!!! Who remembers Circus lol the Married w Children kid?

Except maybe the last one in your collage.  Even though that last part was harder sounding than the original, it was slower.  Or did you slow it down to match the others?  I was thinking that maybe in these competitions you should first understand the original artist's style, and make that your foundation.  Beyond that I would bring your own style in as a texture.  I particularly liked the first version in the collage.  The warm piano is a really nice touch.Don't get me wrong, this is not about how much I like yours, because I totally do.

He is clearly on the flyer for FRUITCAKE but he played GRALINES SHOES amongst others. He also played NO-DOZ at the coconut teaser for Ron D Core many times.  I still believe he was one of the first to put some of the Hip Hop stuff with techno. Obviously no knock on DJ Dan but i heard a tape where he absolutly used a mix 5-10 years after Milky had used it. It was using Ice-Ts colors over a techno beat.  keep posting that stuff and we who were there will keep reliving it. THANKS again!!!!!!!!!!!"

That translucent orange cassette your talking about is called \"FOUR\" and it's by DJ Jon Bishop!  It was my first mix from him and I only picked it for its cool color!  I have many of his cassettes  ( lol) and a few of his first CD's .  I just told him on FB how STRIKE and Four are my favorite all time techno/house mixes...I still play it a few times in my car. It's awesome highway driving music! Ask Jon if you can buy a copy and if he can't do it maybe I could find a cassette to CD player somewhere on this Earth and make you a copy!  LOL"

Nice spot!!  I'm also extremely pleased with myself for spotting  Redux - Da-Da Dancing (Part 1) at 14:00 on Side 2. It's an old Peter Daou record that has quite a few interesting tracks on it.

Dude...I have a story which could maybe give you a little info in hunting down the track. \n   I was over at Doc's house buying records in the early 2000's and he was showing me some old recs and he goes...\"oh yeah do you want this one? It's on one of my old tapes and people have been asking about it but if you dont want it I'm just gonna bury it.\" I listened to the track...recognized the sample and the tune....but wasnt really into it.. (I already had a huge stack of records and I was starting to have to be picky.) So I passed on it....<<<idiot. hahaha But another thing I remember though..and the important part..it was from a compilation. I remember Doc also saying it was a very rare comiplation. \n   Anyways...maybe that will help. I totally understand the hunt dude!!! I'm still on the search for a bunch of missing tunes.

A couple of phrases I've used over the past 15 years to describe Doc:\n\n1) He made me become a dj\n2) Describing any set of his: When Doc walked, you walked, when Doc ran, you ran. (always a visual journey)\n3) Doc can take any 20 records and play them in the exact order that they should be played.\n4)Doc never played a straight line, but rather a gradual rollercoaster.\n5) Doc is the difference between a good dj and a GREAT dj!\n6) Live @ Citrusonic was a mix where Doc took you by the hand and guided you thru the tunnel all the way to the end.\n7) When I get my chance, I will take you thru a journey.\n\nI have bassed every mix I've made as a now 24 year dj, on his style. Its a template for me, and has been for the others worth mentioning. \"Take people for a ride\" .Listen to your records, then make sense of them, understand their connotation, and play them in a way that makes the most impact! I speak very humbly as there are a million djs better than me. BTW, anyone readin this should listen to Josh McClintock's mixes....he understood mixing as I feel defines a great dj!"

The morning after the party, I drove Doc and some other folks back to the city. At some point in the drive, I asked him how things were on the main stage where he played, having spent most of my night at the smaller stage. He responded, \"Good. I had that whirlpool thing happening, which was cool.\" This was followed by silence, as I'm sure everyone in the car was thinking the same thing as me: \"What the hell is he talking about?!\" \n\nTo this day I still wonder what he meant.

This is a historic tape and it would be really cool to ID all the tracks. \n   As far as the \"whirlpool thing\"...hahaha yes Nature Boy...that is some other worldly language that Doc is speaking there!!! I cant tell you how many times Doc has taken me into another dimension...maybe the \"whirlpool thing\" has something to do with that? lol"

Davin rocked the scene for a long time at the Casa with those. So many memories in the early days at the Casa. If there ever was a \"regular\" venue for the scene in the early days I think the Casa was it.\nI can remember going in and seeing people from every color, tribe, and nation... white, black, hispanic, asian, gangbangers, you name it... but everyone just groovin' and getting along.\n\nHouse music, and electronica in general, transcends all of those barriers that we erect between ourselves."

There is a page on Mixcloud - his User name is AnMRecsLA and he has more of these awesome \"Live at Dream\" tapes posted to his Page on there including a great one by Farina and Jenö. Also if you are Real nice & just ask him / Hell probably send you a copy of it - he has a ton of goodies - hit it up..... Also I'm Still waiting on that Full Night at Dream you promised in the comments above.......???!!!  Love this set would love to hear more like it Especially A FULL NITE !!!! Wow ! The same guy I mentioned above - his name is Anthony btw He most likely can help you in identifying what's on the full night, if that is the problem. He's Real Informative about these tapes and really Loves to talk about this stuff but anyway..........It's so Nice to see this site stays up where all the rest have gone down..... This music is absolutely timeless and these files are some of the best stuff that can still be found online for DL these days - I took all of these fine sets long ago plus all the dj dan stuff which All seems to be gone now ?? Wtf ?!... Peace from Chicago, Matt Williams"

I had tapes from Marky, Jeno & Doc.  When I moved back to NYC in 1991 I met Joeski & gave him all the tapes that I had in my collection.  I gave them to Joeski because I thought he'd really dig them.\nIn fact, when I moved to SF in 1989 & met Doc Martin, I had just passed through about 6 or 7 years at the Paradise Garage & had a ton of Larry Levan mixtapes & some really great WBLS-FM by Bobby Konders.  I gave  all of my tapes to Doc & Marky.  Gee, when I met Doc he wasn't even spinning house.  He was spinning Janet Jackson & Digital Underground.  I guess he got schooled real quick.  God bless Doc Martin.  He's an important bridge between the classic Garage sound & the next wave of West Coast Rave."

He would play classic Soul & Funk from the early 70's, then move on to the classic Disco era sound & then on to the House era mixed with New Wave & Rap.  My point here is to demystify dance music a little.  There would be no House music if there wasn't first a James Brown or an Aretha Franklin.  Larry would spin \"Green Onions\" or \"Rock Steady\" or \"Love Is The Message\" every week.  Why?  Respect for the track.  Just a friendly reminder to respect the roots of the culture too.  A lot of DJ's are far removed from the original spirit of the early days of the DJ movement."

DJ Shoe, DJ Grover  and myself (all three of us were Las Vegas's first underground DJ's) we're chilling showing eachother tracks we had and I had mentioned that I was really into slow breaks and some next level shit and Markem says \"hey I think I know what kind of stuff you're into\" and next thing you know he busts out these jaw dropping cuts that (by his and my estimation we're for the average listeners at that time). After he mixed up some trax for me he handed me a tape which had most of these trax on them. I lost the tape through all my moved but I remember exactly what was on the \"A SIDE\" \n\nHere's what it mostly consisted of :\n\n1.\tAxis - Rolling With Rai (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPpPljndLjE) \n2.\tUnique 3 – Weight for the Bass (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqJ78DQczaU) \n3.\tAnoesis - Hemispheres (Part 1) (I couldn’t find the right version on Youtube)\n4.\tMicro & Vicious Vic -  Annihilating (Dark Break Mix) (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2VmCgDGpAY )\n5.\tSouthside Reverb - Reverberation (Neusonic Melodic Remix)( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKw-jRMA0dQ) \n6.\tPizzaman – Trippin on Sunshine (Playboys Fully Loaded Dub) I think this is the one (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSRcE789mmM&playnext=1&list=PL67875E2D997417CE)\n7.\tColorblind - You're Gonna Make Me Love Somebody Else (Jon Dasilva Mix)( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQjsnwU3cnQ) \n8.\tLittle Axe - Ride On (Fight On) (Skip - Mask Mix) (I couldn’t find the right version on Youtube)\n\nEnjoy!

I cannot find what mix this is and I've been looking for years.  Someone help please haha.  Thanks"

I’m a bit late to the party & only discovered Eli Star a few years ago, but I love most of his tapes.  They’re all incredible. \n\nIf anyone sees this at some point & can identify the third track in on side A, I’d love to know what it is.  It starts at like 11:55 & it’s the one that opens with the Flower Duet sample, and then moves into some chanting.  If this helps at all, this song also appears on a tape called ‘Kiss the Sky’ by Thomas Michael.  He uses it as the opener on side B.  Thanks!"

He definitely had a different quality to his music.  I loved it.  Now I'm going to have to dig around in some old boxes and see if I possibly have that tape hidden somewhere.

Another reason I liked him so much was that he would let me carry his records in and I didnt have to pay...lol He threw some of the best parties in Southern California.....Mickey's Holy Water Adventure...Apocalypse...a bunch more I cant remember(most of them at the Casa)..lol Much respect to Steve Koolaid."

That was an epic event for my first \"night out\" and they had smashed a hole in the brick wall of this warehouse and had a slide where you could go from the main room into the disco room (yes, back then they didn't have chill rooms, they have 70's disco rooms with dayglo paint, etc.)"

We were chilling with our friends having a really cool conversation about the scene and the music.  I remember having this conversation because in the first place ..it was inspiring and I could tell that you were very passionate about the music.  I'd seen you at other parties before that and other parties after that, and I could tell you were there cause you loved it as much as I did.  I also remember this conversation because after this party my buddy Chris and I scored the best waves of our lives in Newport Beach!!! It was 4 to 6ft and just perfect. I still dream about those barrels to this day haaha!!! So much good music then so much good waves...just might have been the best day of my life! lol  Just a memory that's been kicking around in my brain for a couple decades...thought I'd share.

I was working for KROQ and POWER 106 doing late night mixes and I had a 4 track teac my dad gave me..... It was fun times, but yes I tried to always put out nothing but perfect mixes etc with my name on it ..... Didn't always succeed, but this was a fun mix and I was in an era of creativity and competitiveness that helped push me to become a better DJ Ultimately !!    Most of these records sadly I no longer have due to my constant moving from city to city, country to country.... but like Jim Morrison once said after being told he'd never play the Ed sullivan Show again, ... I Just played the Ed Sullivan Show !!!  LOL !!    I have all these old mixes to share as they represent my contribution to the rave culture and evolution of music throughout my life and many of yours....

How about release just a few snippets of what he's got to quench our thirst and drum up some support for whatever doc he's working on??? Seems like a no brainer.  I'm actually a little worried about the raw footage...because uh...we were out of our freaking minds that night hahahahaha!! But the MTV footage that aired was fucking PERFECT!!! We can sit around and wait for some (raw footage) that might exist....or somebody can be a LEGEND and hook us up with that short MTV clip. I'm happy to discuss a cash reward for your generosity."

Really motivated cool guy,he was really good at finding locations.One of the really cool thing about the party was that it WAS in a different location every week. Tom also dj'd as well (very well too I must say) The loops were done by M and C productions which was my best friend Jim Hamner and Mark Veltman. They did visuals at many parties....the best one in my opinion being Technoflight at the Sprucegoose where they had all there loops over the huge hull of the actual Sprucegoose (the one loop that sticks in my mind the most is where Catwoman is licking Batman) They were very talented. Mark Veltman went on to become a very succesfull fashion photographer.You can see some of his work at MarkVeltman.com"

Anybody know the track at 109:40?\n   What a fantastic set this is here by Barry. Definitely showcasing his talents. Guy can MIX proper! And has a great ear for what sounds ill.

Thanks for these mixes, your years of serving us music for our souls, for being active on this site,  and for all of the memories these classic mixes bring. \nCheers M8!"

I pretty much layed my heart and soul on the dancefloor.....we danced in celebration of my father and I dedicated the set and recording to him.

I used to have this really cool boombox that I would take everywhere with me (the beach,parking lot of a party,mountains) this tape got a lot of play on that ol thing. BIG THANK YOU again to Jason here at SIMFONIK for digitizing these and posting them up on this AMAZING site! I would also like to let you know that Jason has asked me to do an ACID JUNKY 4 especially for the site. I've almost completed it...and when I do I'll send it in. June, July most likely. I decided to keep in the spirit of things and record it to tape.....i am having a hard time finding actual NICE tapes to buy though hahahaha! Also...I have about 10k more records than when I put out AJ3....so selecting records for it was quite the process. Fun as &^%$ though I must admit! Thank you to everyone that gave these a listen.....back then ..and now. Enjoy!"

Me and much of my underground colleagues hated when we started to hear the underground sound going commercial! We felt ever since Powertools started playing out the UDG started to go south! by 1994 true UDG parties were all gone and taken over by RAVERS!\n\nParties in mansions, barns, broken into warehouses, the foothills with pulsating LAZERS and towers of speakers --- all disappeared when Techno went commercial, Thanks to radio.\n\nMars FM could not compete with the bigger station, they tried to stay and keep it underground, but got eaten up eventually by POWERTOOLS. Listening to Mars FM was like trying to tune into a frequency out of space....it was great! \n\nAHHH I miss those exciting wide eye days!\n\nThat's my 2 cents & I guess is for all.\n\n“Bass is thumpin here a little something to bring down the wall.”\n\nPEACE – The TRUE and ORIGINAL SHAGGY.\n\nONELUV"

The mixes were tight but the house was cheeseball.....I'm shocked to see Jon Williams and Eli Star in the mix here on the show. You were more likely to hear Hardrive - Deep Inside or  Sound Factory - Understand this groove for the millionth time. Hey...they did make A LOT of people happy and inspired a shit load of Dj's.....not my cup of tea though. Much rather listen too Mars FM, or Jason Bentley, or KUCI in Irvine."

They were pompous and acted like they were the creators of the scene. New jacks. When they were playing freestyle at Black Angus we (OG Underground) were rocking out on Santa Fe. Music was cool but they pulled a lot of gimmicks to deceive their listeners, like their fake on the scene rave reports when they were actually in Jerry Merazs garage. F them dudes."

I did appreciate the fact that a lot of my favorite DJs were able to play and get exposure to an audience that might not have heard them otherwise. I'm more of a fan of music than \"scenes\". Along with all of the bad music that unquestionably got played on Power Tools, there was also an incredible amount of pure class music played by some of LA's true underground DJ's --- like RAW, DJ TRANCE, MOONPUP, ALDO BENDER, DOC MARTIN, STEVE LORIA, BARRY WEAVER, etc...

Who knows what was before 1988 as i was just a kid!\n\nAppointed by Executives, producers and Trend Analysts in early 90' they saw the evolution in Techno not \"EDM\" and leaped to expolite the sound.. To be the first to expose this musical Taboo we called techno all over the airway.

I drove from Ventura County \"Camarillo\" weekend after weekend and even weekdays (from 1989 to 1993ish) for the openess and LOVE and the freedom to be who I wanted to be and not who I was not. I remember a later one called Fresh Fruit (they gave out free fruit) and it seemed to be the last REAL LOVE underground I went to other than seeing DOC on the wednesday night of the L.A. riots in the back of a industial park - that was an awesome night/morning! My point is if you where a TRUE believer of the underground you would want to share this music with anyone who liked it and you would not judge it when it got to \"Commercial\" but accept where it went and that more and more people liked it and it opened the eyes of millions to this type of music, vibe and culture.

      "content": "Its this simple. Los Angeles had no electronic music radio outlets at that time unless you were in the scene and or a dj who bought vinyl. There was no mp3, internet, simifonik, soulseek etc. Mixtapes even were still fairly underground prior to the mid-90s. So.....like it or not, Powertools and Marsfm both played commercial shit. I used to record all powertools live on tapes cuz there was no other large variety of Los Angeles Djs & a few outer towners sets available, only cd compilations which were mainly europe style hardcore still. If you stayed up long enough till 3-4am ( yes powertools used to be on for more then 2 hours) they played a lot of underground acid, techno, & some random mixtapes that werent commercial. Dj Orlando, Thee-o, Trance frequently were on, live or by tape. Them dudes played nothing commercial....\n\nBut agree, its all about the underground"

Lot of things went wrong during the process....Had to get new needles.....replace scratched records...new time consuming job...etc etc...The hardest part was actually selecting the tracks because my vinyl collection is enormous these days. In the end...I think it came out pretty good. I'm a perfectionist so there is always something I think I could do better on it....but I'm content with the way it turned out.\n     The first side is my favorite and also gave me the most troubles. My favorite parts are the \"Euphorhythm with the \"my house\" acapella over it..as well as the mix out of it with MDM. And the 2 Fast Eddie tracks just melted together perfectly.\n  Really happy with the second side as well....The mix out of \" House Nation\" to Ikko being my fave.. And the ending to side 2 with \"Acid Bitch\" was perfect."

I put a lot of thought into the tapes .it wasnt just pop a tape in and lets party. I wanted it to play out like a story .with an intro and an ending that made it seem like a journey. I've been playing these in my car and they sound so nice and clean  Jason did a great job digitizing them.Looking forward to the third one being posted in the next couple weeks  the first side on it  Stairway to Heaven  is my favorite recording I have ever done.Thanx again for the kind words Shaggy!"

He even came to my graduation party with my family when I graduated high school! I'd get so excited when he came out with a new tape.  Acid Hits 9 was the first tape I brought home with me from the parties.  I think it was E.S.P or Synergy at the Casa in early 1991 where I bought it off him for $5.  His MEGA MIX special editions  were the shit!!! We kinda had a falling out and after I moved to NY in 1996 I lost touch with him. I've looked for him for years but can't seem to find him. I have a large amount of his tapes (32) that need to get posted up someday. I saw that somebody just posted up Acid Hits 9 on You Tube. Sick!!"

Uh, Josh, I'd love to know the story behind how Therese ended up with a copy of this mix. Yes, it's definitely me! And I totally remember making this mix too - the Le Mystère Des Voix Bulgares meets Moody Blues on the first side intro and that Self Help record at the start of side two are trademark \"me\", as is the use of the train. Also, the \"it's not over, it's____over\" (from one of those DMC Loops And Grooves volumes) trick at the end of side two is a dead giveaway...\nI have no idea why it was not released, or what my intention was for this mix. I couldn't begin to tell you what it was going to be called. If I had to make a guess I'd say it might have been intended as a next Milky Way tape, but I'm not really sure. Hell, I wouldn't have been able to even pinpoint the year I made it, so if you say 1991, I'll buy that! Oh, and thanks guys for IDing most of the tracks! Appreciate it."

And very interesting to hear you had a copy of this mix as well. \n      On a side note.. few days ago I bought a copy of \"Confusion Club - Move\" that appears on this tape off Discogs. It was the last copy available in the U.S. and I was stoked to have it after all these years. It wasn't until I got my Paypal statement that I came to the realization that I had just bought it off THE MAN MR BARRY WEAVER!!! Haha!! I hit him up and we had a nice chat. He told me the copy I was buying was most definitely the one used in this mix! Stoked!!"
