# Mixtape Archive – Agent Rules

## Goal
Build a simple, functioning website for a DJ mixtape archive.

## Working style
- Before coding, propose a short plan and list assumptions.
- Keep implementations minimal and incremental.
- Prefer editing existing files over rewriting.
- If a requirement is ambiguous, ask before building.

## Guardrails
- Do not add auth/admin features in v1.
- Do not introduce extra services unless explicitly requested.
